    <h1>Water Pump Monitoring System</h1>

    <p>This project is a simple web application that displays information about water pumps, including their status, pressure, and active/inactive state. The application fetches data from a MySQL database and dynamically generates the content using PHP and HTML.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Displays a grid of pump details, including ID, status, pressure, and active/inactive state.</li>
        <li>Uses CSS for styling, with green and red boxes indicating pump status and activity.</li>
        <li>Implements pagination to navigate through pump records in the database.</li>
        <li>Retrieves data from a MySQL database using PHP and displays it on the web page.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>Before running this application, ensure you have the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A web server (e.g., Apache) with PHP support.</li>
        <li>A MySQL database with the necessary table (<code>maintable</code> in this case) and relevant data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Clone the repository to your web server's document root directory:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/unreliablecode/ewater-monitor.git</code></pre>
    
    <ol start="2">
        <li>Create a MySQL database named <code>ewatermonitor</code>.</li>
        <li>Import the necessary data into the database. You can find a sample SQL file in the repository (<code>database_dump.sql</code>).</li>
        <li>Modify the database connection details in the PHP code:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre><code>
        Open <code>index.php</code> and update the following lines with your database credentials:
        $servername = "localhost";
        $username = "your_username";
        $password = "your_db_password";
        $dbname = "your_db_name";
    </code></pre>

    <ol start="5">
        <li>Start your web server and access the application through a web browser.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Upon accessing the application, you'll see a grid of pump details.</li>
        <li>Pump status is indicated by green (Active) and red (Inactive) boxes.</li>
        <li>Pump pressure and status (Normal/ERROR) are displayed for each pump.</li>
        <li>Pagination links at the bottom allow you to navigate through pump records.</li>
    </ul>
